# YASE
YASE is a search engine capable to provide search results for the **MS Marco document collection**, a large dataset available on GitHub which is commonly used for researchin Information Retrieval.
The application is composed of the following modules:
- Indexer that creates the data structures, such as the inverted index, lexicon and document index, which allow efficient search by mapping terms to the documents that contain them.
- Query executorthat process the userâ€™s queries, supporting conjunctive and disjunctive research, and returns the search results. It implements both TF-IDF and BM25 scoring functions.

Furthermore YASE also employs dynamic pruning techniques such as MaxScore in order to boost the performances of the query processing. The search engine also adopts simple compression techniques to reduce the size of the inverted index in order to be performant also in terms of memory usage while maintaining fast search response.  

The user can exploit the functionalities of YASE through a user-friendly CLI.

## Set up

Once imported the project you can retrieve the * *jar* * lunching the following command from the **SearchEngine** folder:
```
mvn assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies install 
```
Now you should have * *yase.jar* * in the **YASE** folder and you can run it with one of the following options:
```
usage: java -jar yase.jar [options]
  -i,--index      Create the index by processing the collection at the following path:
                  'SearchEngine/src/main/resources/collection.tar.gz' (MSMARCO collection)
  -s,--search     Start using the search engine (Index is needed).
  -t,--test       Creates a results file ready to be used to evaluate the effectiveness
                  of the search engine with trec_eval (Index is needed).
```
**NOTE**: remember to move the MS Marco collection in the following folder:
* *YASE/SearchEngine/src/main/resources/collection.tar.gz*
